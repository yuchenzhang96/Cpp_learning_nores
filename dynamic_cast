Dynamic Cast: a cast is an operator that converts data from one type to another type. In C++, dynamic casting is mainly used for safely downcasting at run time. To work on dynamic_cast there must be one virtual function in the base class. A dynamic_cast works only polymorphic base class because it uses this info to decide downcasting.

dynamic_cast<new_type>(expression)

Downcasting: cast a base class pointer to a derived class pointer.
Upcasting: cast a derived class pointer to a base class pointer.
