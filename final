final keyword in c++

1. declare class as final:

struct Base final {};
struct Derived : Base {}; // a 'final' class type cannot be used as a base class

2. declare function as final:

struct Base {
    virtual void f() final;
};

struct Derived : Base
{
    void f(); // cannot override 'final' function "Base::f" (declared at line 2)
};
